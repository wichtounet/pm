pm 0.1
========

Simple project manager in Python. This application helps you keeping track of the status of your projects in their Source Code Management (SCM) system. 

For now, pm only supports Git. 

Normally, it should be compatible Python 2.7 and Python 3.x. Post an issue if you find something that is not compatible one of these versions and I'll do my best to improve that.
